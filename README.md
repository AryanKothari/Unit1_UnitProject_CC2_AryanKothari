# Unit1_UnitProject_CC2_AryanKothari
<h2> Description: </h2>
<p> This unit project is my development of what I did for project 2. In this game, Bob's mission is to get to his pizza, 
 while blocking the objects falling from the sky. Since the creater of the game, ME, is generous, You are provided with three lives before losing. Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor!  <p>

<h2> Inspirtation: </h2>
<p> For this project, I wanted to make something interactive with the person using it. That combined with the idea that something with a story line will be more intriguing to the audience, It eventually led to the development of this game. To make it feel as if it were in a story, I tried to utilize the powers of images and sounds. <p>
